&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one learns a any new programming language, one first starts off with a simple program which output "Hello World". I have always been fascinated by this ritual. It is like opening a door to a new world of wonders.   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am writing my first blog entry. Not strictly the first though. I once wrote a blog as a school assignment, with all the mumbling. This blog is the one that come out of my free will. There are many times I need to write down to give structure and clarity to what I am thinking. I figure it will be better if I put it up publicly, as self-consciousness will make me produce more serious work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a software engineer. My concerns nowadays mostly revolve around technical bits. So you can expect this blog to be mostly technical. But sometimes, it will be about other things as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P/S: About the blog name, I am just trying to be funny&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="random"></category></entry></feed>
