Smartphone landscape has never been this hot, with RIM introduces their new OS platform, [Blackberry 10 OS](http://sg.blackberry.com/software/smartphones/blackberry-10-os.html). The Software have been a critical wining factor in the phone war. It appeals to users in two ways: providing the best user experience or creating a strong ecosystem. The later can be acchieved by being attractive to application developers. The two late commer, Ubuntu and Firefox are doing just that. The new [Ubuntu for Phone](http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone) is recently released. It emphasises on the large community already supporting Ubuntu platform. [Firefox OS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS), which is under heavy development, portraits itself as the platform of Open Web Applications. It enables developers to write platform-independent applications in HTML5, CSS and Javascript. 

While other smartphone OSes might also support the deployment of web apps, Firefox OS caught my interest by its different proposition: Web apps will be the first-class citizen. Device-level functions like phone call or sms which are usually served by native apps could be built into web apps with the [Web Runtime API](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI). 

I have tried buiding and flashing Firefox OS into my Galaxy Nexus phone.
